> **Note**

> Duplicate modules are not supported, for good practices

> filter using the `exclude` options, don't use ~~[Packaging patterns](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/packaging)~~

>In handler.py, **shared** code can be imported like this:
```py
from common_utils import shared_resource
```

## Future Features Coming Soon ™️
---
- [ ] custom schema validation module via `input_types` & `output_types`
- [ ] support openapi lambda type via `openapi: true`, false by default, as it creates an extra lambda resource
- [ ] zip deeper deps filtering for pyc and pyo files
## Requirements
---
- [x] python & pip installed
- [x] minimum required node version >= 16
