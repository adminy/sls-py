> filter using the `exclude` option.

>In handler.py, **shared** code can be imported like this:
```py
from common_utils import shared_resource
```

## Requirements
---
- [x] python & pip installed
- [x] minimum required node version >= 16

### Features
- `shared` is attached to all the lambdas.
  - you can place repeated dependencies inside your shared layer to:
    - save space.
    - reduce cold startup time.
    - much faster deployments.
- `exclude` works for excluding code and dependencies alike.
